## mod_rpaf - reverse proxy add forward

This module gets values of host and remote address from an reverse proxy,
sets host and remote addresss to httpd.
This module was originally written by Thomas Eibner <thomas@stderr.net>.

The differences from the original module are:
* Feature: Support for partial IP address as '10.1.' for RPAFproxy_ips. The author of this patch is unknown.
* Bugfix: In the case of APR_HAVE_IPV6-enabled build, access control of Order/Allow/Deny does not work correctly.
* Support of httpd 1.3 was deleted.
